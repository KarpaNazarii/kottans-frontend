# kottans-frontend

Hello! I liked the first steps of this course, the version control system "Git", which I have been familiar with for a long time, is exactly the thing that cannot be done without in modern development. Having familiarized myself with the proposed materials, I slightly refreshed my "rusty" knowledge. I feel inspired to learn something new, so I run further up the steps of the course!
